This package allows you to write an continued equality such as

    \begin{conteq}
    e^{\pi\cdot i} \\
    = -1 & Euler's formula \\
    < 0 & this is an inequality \\
    < \sqrt 3 \\
    = \int e^{-x^2} dx & this is due to Gauss.
    \end{conteq}

in a declarative manner and easily switch between various layouts afterwards.
